# Assignment #3

1. Download the three ranking data sets from EEE: SE, HCI, CSCW. These data sets represent the productivity of individual faculty members in three areas of research (Software Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Supported Cooperative Work) for a series of different universities. The higher the number, the more impactful that particular faculty memberâ€™s publications have been.

2. You will create visualizations for each of these data sets. The purpose of your visualizations will be to show how UCI ranks in these three areas relative to other universities. Consider the audience to be academic administrators, who are concerned about the relative ranking of their faculty, and prospective students, who want to know how UCI is doing or whether they should attend UCI if they want to study one of these areas. One tricky issue is that there are different numbers of faculty in the various areas at the different universities. You will have to give some thought as to how to handle this in your visualizations.

3. Choose two different kinds of visualizations, then develop one of each kind for the three data sets (six visualizations total)

4. Explain the two kinds of visualizations you selected and why you selected them. Then, using principles from the text or lectures (with the source identified) explain which kind of visualization is superior for these data and why. Keep in mind the audiences for which these visualizations are intended.

5. Paste all of your visualizations into a document (make sure they are labeled correctly) and put your text below. Also include your D3 code. Save as a .pdf file and submit the file to the Assignment 3 EEE dropbox.
